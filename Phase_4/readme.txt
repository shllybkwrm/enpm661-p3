Phase 3
To run code:
python AstarWithTurtleBot_mmUnits.py
Code will prompt for inputs:  Wheel RPMs, obstacle clearance, start & goal points.
Submission video was run with RPMs=50, clearance=10mm, start=(-4000,-3000)mm, and goal=(4000,3000)mm.

Dependencies:
numpy
matplotlib


Phase 4
Unfortunately neither of our computers could handle Gazebo so we were unable to complete the videos.  We will discuss this with the professor.  We are including the rospy code for reference.

Dependencies:
numpy
matplotlib
ROS Kinetic
Gazebo
